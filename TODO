* Finish prosecuting bugs in the Google Code tracker;
  either develop test cases for them or deem them invalid/unreproducible/wontfix
  (new bugs should go in the github tracker).  Also look for bugs filed against
  the PHP implementation (such as in the Textpattern tracker); those bugs
  may also exist in this implementation.

* Improve test coverage (use coverage stats in docs/coverage/index.html).

* Consider stripping out HTML validation code.
  Validation is also not a concern of a text formatting library;
  with restricted=True, Textile _should_ produce valid HTML or XHTML.
  If user-generated HTML is allowed (as is the case when restricted=False,
  the default), then all bets are off.  Genshi or lxml with BeautifulSoup
  can generally do something useful with user-provided tag soup.

* Improve documentation, both of the code and Textile syntax.
  The previous version of pytextile had excellent inline documentation;
  similarly, docstrings such as "What does this do?" should be improved.

* Address the 'hu' variable (which is a holdover from Textpattern); either
  remove it (which is to say that Textile has no business resolving
  relative URLs), or provide a means for it to be set to a meaningful value.
