* Improve test coverage
   nose is configured to produce coverage statistics.

* Improve documentation, both of the code and Textile syntax.
   Not all functions have docstrings or adequate docstrings.
   Because the Textile syntax implemented by pytextile has deviated from
   the syntax implemented by the PHP implementation of Textile,
   pytextile-specific documentation needs to be produced for end-users.
  

* Address outstanding architectural issues:
   The Textile class has a large number of public methods which are, in fact,
   not intended to be called by the public.
   Also, some parameters are set in __init__(), while others are set in
   textile().
   Because various instance variables get set while text is being processed,
   a Textile object cannot be reused--that is, it is not possible to set up
   a Textile object with the desired parameters, and then use it repeatedly
   to process multiple strings, because parameters such as the shelf do not
   get reset between calls to textile().
   
* Re-implement HTML sanitization:
   HTML sanitization was stripped out due to sgmllib's deprecation; if
   re-implemented, html5lib should be used.
