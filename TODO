* Finish prosecuting bugs in the Google Code tracker;
  either develop test cases for them or deem them invalid/unreproducible/wontfix
  (new bugs should go in the github tracker).  Also look for bugs filed against
  the PHP implementation (such as in the Textpattern tracker); those bugs
  may also exist in this implementation.

* Improve test coverage (use coverage stats in docs/coverage/index.html).

* Improve documentation, both of the code and Textile syntax.
  The previous version of pytextile had excellent inline documentation;
  similarly, docstrings such as "What does this do?" should be improved.
